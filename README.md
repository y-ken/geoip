Ruby GeoIP Bindings
=======================

What?
-----

This is a library which provides a single function. The function takes as
input an IP address and it outputs a hash containing best-guess geographical
information (like city, country, latitude, and longitude).

Actually this is only a Ruby binding to a C library which provides this
function. Also, you must download a large binary database with all this
mapping information. It is kindly provided free of charge by MaxMind.com. 

Usage

    require 'geoip-c'
    db = GeoIP::City.new('/opt/GeoIP/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat')
    result = db.look_up('24.24.24.24')
    p result 
    # => {:city=>"Ithaca", 
    #     :latitude=>42.4277992248535, 
    #     :longitude=>-76.4981994628906, 
    #     :country_code3=>"USA", 
    #     :country_code=>"US",
    #     :country_name=>"United States", 
    #     :dma_code=>555,
    #     :area_code=>607, 
    #     :region=>"NY" }

There are arguments to database initializer.

  1. The first argument is the filename of the GeoIPCity.dat file 

  2. The second argument (optional) is to specify how GeoIP should
     keep the database in memory. There are three possibilities

      * `:filesystem` -- Read database from filesystem, uses least memory.

      * `:index` -- The most frequently accessed index portion of the
        database, resulting in faster lookups than :filesystem, but less
        memory usage than :memory.

      * `:memory` -- (Default.) Load database into memory, faster performance but uses more memory.

  3. The third argument is boolean and decides whether the system should
     reload the database if changes are made to the dat file. (You probably
     don't need this. Default: false.)

For example 

    GeoIP::City.new(dbfile, :filesystem, true)

Usage for Organization Search
-----------------------------

    require 'geoip-c'
    db = GeoIP::Organization.new('/opt/GeoIP/share/GeoIP/GeoIPOrg.dat')
    db.look_up('24.24.24.24')
    # => {:name=>"Road Runner"}

The name is the only data available for Organizations.

Install
-------

Some variation of the following should work.

  1. Install the GeoCity C library. You can get it from
  [MaxMind](http://www.maxmind.com/app/c).
  For example, I like to install mine in `/opt/GeoIP`, so I do this:

        tar -zxvf GeoIP-1.4.3.tar.gz 
        cd GeoIP-1.4.3
        ./configure --prefix=/opt/GeoIP
        make && sudo make install

    On Mac OS X, you can install using [homebrew](http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew):

        brew install geoip

    Linux platforms utilizing Apt have several packages available:

        geoip-bin
        geoip-database
        libgeoip-dev

  2. Now install the `geoip` gem

        gem install geoip-c -- --with-geoip-dir=/opt/GeoIP

    Alternatively, if you installed libgeoip using homebrew:

        gem install geoip-c

  3. Download the GeoLite City database file in binary format at http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
     Maybe this [direct link](http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz) will work.
     I put this file in 

        /opt/GeoIP/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat

    If you installed libgeoip using homebrew then put it in:

        /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat

     If you are a paying customer, you will download the files required below:

     [MaxMind Customer Downloads](http://www.maxmind.com/app/download_files)

     You will want to get the City Rev1 data file and Organization files at minimum.

  4. Use it!

     See above for usage details.

Hints
-----

  1. Might need to set

        export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386"

    to be able to compile the gem.

    Example:

        env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install geoip-c -- --with-geoip-dir=/opt/GeoIP

  2. You might find [this shell script](http://github.com/grimen/my_shell_scripts/blob/8cf04cb6829e68a47f2d6f9d9e057766ea72beb4/install_geoip-city.sh)
     helpful to install the C library.
